# My Portfolio Webpage

## Description

This website is where i have cataloged my projects along my developer journey. The motivation behind its design is my home of Vancouver Island. I wanted to encompass the mountains and woods that cover the island itself. 

I have learnt many things while creating this website such as Advanced CSS and HTML. But i have also learnt of many websites and resources that can help me in the future as well.
